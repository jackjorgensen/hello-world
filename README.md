# hello-world
My first github project

Hello computers!

Jack here, I like Google Apps Script, and to be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing when I'm coding.
I hope to change that soon. I am learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I hope to create
beautiful web applications that I can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time.
